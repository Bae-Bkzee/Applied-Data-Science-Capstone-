Foursquare API:\n   Four-square API as its prime data gathering source as it has a database of millions of places, especially their places API which provides the ability to perform location search, location sharing and details about a business.\n\n2. Clustering:\n   To compare the similarities of two cities, the neighborhoods will be explored, segmented , and grouped into clusters to find similar neighborhoods. Thus k-means clustering algorithm will be employed\n\n3. Libraries Used:\n   - Pandas: For creating and manipulating dataframes.\n   - Folium: Python visualization library would be used to visualize the neighborhoods cluster distribution of using interactive leaflet map.\n   - Scikit Learn: For importing k-means clustering.\n   - JSON: Library to handle JSON files.\n   - XML: To separate data from presentation and XML stores data in plain text format.\n   - Geocoder: To retrieve Location Data.\n   - Beautiful Soup and Requests: To scrap and library to handle http requests.\n   - Matplotlib: Python Plotting Module.\n\n### Data Description:\n- Data for this project was retrieved from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_postal_codes_of_Canada:_M\"> List of postal codes of Canada: M i.e. Toronto</a>\n- Scarborough dataset which was scrapped from this page in the past or previous project will be used to further this study and observation. Dataset consisting of latitude and longitude, zip codes.\n- The data retrieved contains info of venues within a specified distance of the longitude and latitude of the postcodes. \n- The information obtained per venue as follows:\n  1. Neighborhood\n  2. Neighborhood Latitude\n  3. Neighborhood Longitude\n  4. Venue\n  5. Name of the venue e.g. the name of a store or restaurant\n  6. Venue Latitude\n  7. Venue Longitude\n  8. Venue Category"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "### Links to:\n   1.
